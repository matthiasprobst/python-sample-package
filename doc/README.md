Run

    make clean

to remove the build directory.

Next, run

    sphinx-build -b html . _build

to create `index.html` in the `_build/` folder (You may need to install the theme first: `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`)

To update the pdf, run

    sphinx-build -b latex . _build

and after that run the make file in the source folder to build the actual pdf.

View `build/index.html` with your browser.
