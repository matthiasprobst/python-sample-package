# Sample package

Sample package including general package structure, testing with pytest and documentation with sphinx.

If you want to create your own package, you can use this package as starting point.

*Note, that the repository is under current development!*

## Installation
If you use `anaconda`, you may first create an environment:

     conda create -n sampleprojet python=3.8
     conda activate samplepackage

Navigate to the repository directory.

For development:

    pip install -e ".[complete]"
otherwise

    pip install ".[complete]"

To only install special functionality, e.g. only vtk support in addition to core dependendies, run:

    pip install (-e) ".[docs]"


## Documentation
Documentation can be build following the README.md in the doc/ folder

## Testing
Go to the repository directory. For running all tests call
```
pytest
```
To get a coverage report run (you need the package `pytest-cov`):
```
pytest --cov --cov-report html
```
This will create a folder `covhtml/` with an `index.html` file in it.
